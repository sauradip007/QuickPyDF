As per the MRM policy requirement, model should be reviewed annually to
ensure the model usage for the next year. This year model was due for
revalidation, hence re-validation is performed and submitted at place of Annual
Model Review (AMR). An AMR will be submitted for the model in the next annual
validation exercise to be held in October this year on the latest available
performance results during the validation.
The performance checks would include metrics like PSI, KS, ROB, MAPE etc. and
all MRM required metrics for AMR.
